# Hello Node!

Building on our [simple node.js example](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/cci-node-express?path=README.md%3A1%3A0),
this sends accelerometer, gyroscope, and touch data from connected clients' devices (ideally, phones) to the server to be visualized by a "shared view".
The shared view code shows a display of all connected clients, accessible via `public/sharedView.html`, and using `public/sharedView.js` to handle the visualization with p5.js.

`public/client.js` sends the data from its device using p5.js and socket.io, and is connected to `public/index.html` so that it is the default code for the page.

This app serves as an example for showing a different display on a "shared view" node (say, a large scale display in an installation), while providing a different localized experience for participants in their own devices.
The shared view is a client with a specialized role and display.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) is a popular runtime that lets you run server-side JavaScript.
This project uses the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework.
Please do not upgrade to Express version 5, which is incompatible with the version of node.js that Glitch uses.

## Prerequisites

You'll get best use out of this project if you're familiar with basic JavaScript.
If you've written JavaScript for client-side web pages this is a little different because it uses server-side JS, but the syntax is the same!

## What's in this project?

‚Üê `README.md`: That‚Äôs this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

‚Üê `public/style.css`: The styling rules for the pages in your site.

‚Üê `public/client.js`: The JavaScript for the site's front-end. This connects to a socket to talk to the server and uses p5.js and socket.io to send data about user interactions/data on the device.

‚Üê `public/index.html`: This is the main index for the site. In other Glitch examples, you may see HTML templates with libraries like Handlebars instead of an index.html

‚Üê `public/sharedView.html`: Shows all connected clients (except for itself) in a visualization.

‚Üê `public/sharedView.js`: Provides the JavaScript (p5.js and socket.io) necessary to render the visualizations in host.js

‚Üê `server.js`: The **Node.js** server script for your new site. In this example, we set up some socket.io communication between client & host in addition to serving HTML, CSS, and JS files.

‚Üê `package.json`: The NPM packages for your project's dependencies.

Note: this is a template developed by Glitch and uses Fastify instead of Express.
Both libraries are similar in function, but have different syntax.
